# Variables are containers for values such as strings, integers, floats and booleans
# Variables behavior is dependent on the value that it contains
first_name = "Sherrard"

print(first_name)# Prints the value of the variable first_name

print("first_name")# Prints the word first_name because the quotations turn the variable to a string

print(f"{first_name}")# Prints the value of the variable first_name using f string
#                       f strings allow variable values to be printed while in quotation marks
#                       The f stands for format
